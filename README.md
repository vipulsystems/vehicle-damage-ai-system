# 🚗 Vehicle Damage AI System

## 📌 Overview

An end-to-end **AI-powered vehicle damage detection and repair cost estimation system** that automates inspection using computer vision and backend intelligence.

The system allows users to upload an image of a damaged vehicle, detects affected parts using a YOLOv8 model, and estimates repair cost based on structured pricing data stored in PostgreSQL.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional vehicle damage assessment is:

* Time-consuming
* Dependent on human expertise
* Prone to inconsistency

This system provides:

* Automated damage detection
* Standardized cost estimation
* Faster and data-driven decision-making

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

### 🔍 AI-Based Damage Detection

* YOLOv8 object detection model
* Detects vehicle parts (Bumper, Door, Light, etc.)
* Confidence-based filtering

---

### 💰 Cost Estimation Engine

* Dynamic pricing based on:

  * Vehicle brand & model
  * Detected damage parts
* Applies damage factor for realistic estimation

---

### 🧠 Scalable Backend Architecture

* Layered architecture:

  ```
  Routes → Controllers → Services → Repositories
  ```
* Clean separation of concerns

---

### 🗄️ PostgreSQL Integration

* Stores:

  * User data
  * Damage reports
  * Cost breakdown (JSONB)
* Enables analytics & reporting

---

### 📊 Report Management

* Stores historical damage reports
* Supports future analytics (cost trends, damage frequency)

---

### 🔐 Authentication System

* Secure user registration & login
* Password hashing using bcrypt

## 🔄 Workflow

1. User uploads image
2. Backend processes image
3. YOLO detects damaged parts
4. Parts mapped & counted
5. Pricing fetched from database
6. Cost calculated
7. Report stored
8. Result returned
